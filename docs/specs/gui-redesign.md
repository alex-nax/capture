# Spec: GUI v3 redesign + `app.rs` decomposition

_Status: **PLANNED** (v3). Visual source of truth = `design/CAPTURE-HANDOFF.md` + `design/Capture Screens
(standalone).html` (the Claude-design export). This spec covers HOW we land it: the module decomposition,
the rules, and the feature breakdown. Update it in the same change as the code._

## Purpose
Two things at once, both on the `gui/` crate:
1. **Decompose the monster** — `gui/src/app.rs` is **4,116 lines**: one ~1,100-line `render()` with the
   dashboard + settings inline, plus `render_playback`, all the action methods, and the `icon`/`button`/
   `chip` free fns. Split it **by screens, components, and domains** so each file is small and single-purpose.
2. **Apply the redesign** — the locked dark system from the handoff (indigo `#6366f1` accent, pure-gray
   neutral ramp on `#1b1b1d`, tight 4–6px radii, full semantic colors, Inter + JetBrains Mono, a 4px spacing
   scale) across new component primitives and restyled/restructured screens.

The decomposition lands **first** (behavior-preserving), so the redesign work happens in small, focused
files instead of a 4k-line monolith.

### Decomposition rules
- **`CaptureApp` stays the single GPUI model**; its fields become **`pub(crate)`** so the `impl CaptureApp`
  blocks in `screens/` and `domain/` (same crate) can read/mutate state. (The orphan rule allows `impl` in any
  module of the defining crate.)
- **Components are free functions** taking explicit params + a listener — no `&self`. **Screens are
  `impl CaptureApp` methods** (they need broad state). **Domain actions are `impl CaptureApp` methods** grouped
  by concern.
- **No raw literals** outside `theme.rs` — colors/sizes/spacing/radii come from named tokens. *Acceptance for
  the decomposition+theme features:* `grep -nE "rgb\(0x|px\([0-9]" gui/src/screens gui/src/components` returns
  only `theme::` references.
- The decomposition feature is **behavior-preserving** — same screens, same actions, just relocated +
  `cargo build` clean; the visual change comes in the later features.

## Design system + components + screens
The tokens (§3), component state matrices (§4), screen & state inventory (§5 — Settings/left-nav,
Dashboard + permission-denied, Playback saved + live, preset picker, the runtime→model-list rule), and the
**GPUI translation notes** (§7 — no glow/blur/multi-layer shadows; elevation = neutral ramp + 1px border;
native window chrome; real frame image in playback; runtime-driven model list) are authoritative in
`design/CAPTURE-HANDOFF.md`. Implement to that + the HTML export; this spec does not duplicate them.

## Notable behavior changes (beyond styling)
- **Dashboard**: per-app **Start capture** in each Windows group header (enabled **iff** a window of that app
  is selected) replaces the per-app mic pill; **Refresh** → Windows header; **Import** → Sessions header.
- **Settings**: long scroll → **left-nav pane + content panel**; brand/daemon/hotkey/status move into the nav.
- **Voice recognition** (#83 ASR onboarding): a **two-step picker**. **Step 1** = the speech-engine list —
  one **row** per registry runtime (name + `requires` line) with a state-driven control: `✓ Active` +
  `Configure` (open the active engine's config) · `Select` (a ready installed local engine — activate it +
  open its config) · `Download` (pack install, #81, with the new `download` glyph) · `Unavailable` (dimmed,
  when hardware is absent — e.g. CUDA on a Mac) · `Coming soon` (a chip under the description + a disabled
  Select — the Remote backend isn't wired yet, #80) · or an in-flight thin bar + `downloading · NN%`. The active engine gets the §4 selected-row treatment. Once a runtime is active the
  list **collapses** to a `✓ Engine: <label> · Change` summary (`asr_engine_expanded` re-expands it) and
  **Step 2** appears. Step 2 follows an explicit `asr_engine_selected` (the engine being configured), not
  the resolved-active flag — so selecting Remote shows Remote's endpoint card even though a local engine
  stays resolved-active until Remote has an endpoint. **Step 2** = the model catalog **for the active runtime**: rows with
  `active`+Remove · `downloaded`+Use+Remove · `Download` · or `download failed`+Retry (failures are kept in
  `LiveState.asr_failed` so they're recoverable, never silent). A model **download in flight** becomes a
  vertical block — name + `downloading` on top, a full-width `progress_bar`, then `656 MB / 1.6 GB · 41%`
  (left) and `~2 min left · 9.4 MB/s` (right), derived from the real `downloaded`/`total` bytes in the
  `asr_download` SSE + an EMA-smoothed rate (`LiveState.asr_dl`). Remote runtime → endpoint card (no local
  list). Step banners ("Step 1 of 2") guide setup but never nag once an engine is active. **Nothing
  auto-selects** — transcription is reported on only when a runtime AND a model are both active. Wires the
  ASR-model + runtime-pack (#81) APIs (`/v1/asr/runtimes`, `/runtimes/install`, `/runtime`, `/models`,
  `/models/download`, `/model`, `/models/delete`).
- **Permissions**: explicit granted / not-granted rows; the **permission-denied dashboard** (blocking banner,
  Windows blocked empty state, mic/launch disabled, Sessions still usable) is a real state to wire to the
  `/v1/permissions` checks.
- **Live playback**: REC badge + streaming transcript + Stop/elapsed/level/segments + live mic & language.

## Implementation features (order = dependency order)
`#68` decompose → `#69` theme → `#70` components+icons → then the screens (`#71` settings shell, `#72`
settings sections, `#73` dashboard, `#74` dashboard permission states, `#75` playback saved+live, `#76` preset/
confirm modals). See `features.json`.

## Tests / acceptance
- Each feature: `cargo build --release` clean; matches the handoff/HTML for that screen/component.
- Decomposition + theme: the no-raw-literals grep above; no behavior change vs the pre-refactor app.
- No new web-only effects (blur/backdrop-filter/box-shadow) — GPUI primitives only (handoff §7).
